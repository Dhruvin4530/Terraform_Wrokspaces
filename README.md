# How to manage multiple environments with terraform workspaces?

### What is Terraform?

Terraform is a free and open-source infrastructure as code (IAC) that can help to automate the deployment, configuration, and management of the remote servers. Terraform can manage both existing service providers and custom in-house solutions.

### What is Terraform Workspaces?

Workspaces in the Terraform CLI refer to separate instances of state data inside the same Terraform working directory. They are distinctly different from workspaces in Terraform Cloud, which each have their own Terraform configuration and function as separate working directories. Using workspaces you can manage different environments easily!
